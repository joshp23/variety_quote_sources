builder of the house. Continuous rebirth is a painful thing. But now,

from active thought, and has made an end of craving."

true wisdom understands the Four Noble Truths of Suffering, the Origin
of Suffering, the End of Suffering and the Noble Eightfold Path, leading

sage is said to be admirable."

religion."

always persevering in what IS their affair. The inflow of thoughts in
such recollected and aware people simply dies away."

.
"The wise say that it is not an iron, wooden or fibre fetter which is a
strong one, but the besotted hankering after trinkets, children and

remaining recollected, now he will make an end of craving, he will snap
the bonds of Mara. His aim is accomplished, he is without fear, rid of
craving and without stain. He has removed the arrows of changing
existence. This is his last body."
